# Speech-To-Text Recognition
1. Install the necessary libraries such as Pydub, GoogleTrans and SpeechRecognition.
2. To convert speech to text of any audio, then replace the audio filename.
3. Currently, the audio file which I have used is in Hindi Language and the destination language is in English.
4. The source is not required, and it can be in any language but it is necessary to define destination language.
